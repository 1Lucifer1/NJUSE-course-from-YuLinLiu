III. 完形：
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
132. Two of the most common first impressions that foreigners have of Koreans is that they are incredibly polite, and that they are incredibly rude. In fact, the __(1) __ and kindness of Koreans is legendary and attested to (被证实) by thousands of people who are __(2)__ enough to have a Korean friend. Overwhelming meals, __(3)__ gifts: all of this and more has been yours if you have been invited out. This is not a modern invention; traditionally, one of the names of Korea was the “Eastern Land of Courtesy”. The obligations of a host are paramount; the obligation of the guest is to lap it up. On the other hand, the discourtesy and __(4)__ of Koreans is legendary and attested to by thousands of people who are unfortunate enough to have to walk on a Korean __(5)__. Overwhelming __(6)__, unexpected shoving, constant and almost painful inattention to where other people are going: all this and more has been yours if you have gone outside. This may be a modern invention. Westerners have rather a hard time reconciling these two __(7)__ of Korea, these two different sets of behavior, both of them from the same people. Hosts are so friendly; taxi drivers are so __(8)__. Is Korea really composed of two totally different sets of people living on the same land? Actually, yes. For Koreans, the world is composed of two sets of people―those they know and those they don’t know. If you know somebody, then you have a relationship, and are __(9)__ to treat him politely. But if you don’t know someone, if you’ve never formally “met” that person, then the person doesn’t exist. Such people don’t__(10)__, and you don’t have to do anything. It turns out that all sorts of things in Korean society are explained by this distinction between “in” and “out”.

133. What are the basic elements of good manners? Certainly a strong sense of justice is one; courtesy is often nothing more than a highly developed sense of fair play. A friend of mine once told me of __(1)__ along a one-lane, unpaved mountain road. Ahead was another car that produced clouds of choking __(2)__, and it was a long way to the nearest __(3)__ highway. Suddenly, at a wider place, the car ahead pulled off the road. Thinking that its owner might have engine trouble, my friend stopped and asked if anything was wrong. "No," said the other driver. "But you've __(4)__ my dust this far; I'll put up with yours the rest of the way." Another __(5)__ of courtesy is empathy, a quality that __(6)__ a person to see into the mind or heart of someone else to understand the pain or unhappiness there and to do something to __(7)__ it. A man dining alone in a restaurant was trying to unscrew the cap of a beer bottle, but he couldn't do it because of badly injured __(8)__. He asked a young busboy to help him. The boy took the bottle, turned his back momentarily and loosened the cap without difficulty. Then he __(9)__ it again. Turning back to the man, he pretended to make great efforts to open the bottle without success. Finally he took it into the kitchen and returned shortly, saying that he had managed to loosen it―but only with a pair of pliers (钳子). Yet another component of politeness is the ability to treat all people __(10)___, regardless of all status or importance. Even when you have doubts about some people, act as if they are worthy of your best manners. You may also be astonished to find out that they really are. Courtesy is the key to a happier world.
